# Sampled-Policy-Gradient-and-variants
 
# A suite of deterministic algorithms along with proposed extensions of SPG

# Introduction

This repository consists of all the codebase and the supporting files for the MSc thesis entitled "Extensions of Sampled Policy Gradient".
With good coding habits and I present a clean and easy implementation of all the proposed algorithms, well maintained and documented in this repository. We follow the same file pattern as done in Fujimoto's TD3 repository.

# Setup
To begin setting up the environment, create a `pip` virtual environment as follows:
```
python3 -mvenv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
